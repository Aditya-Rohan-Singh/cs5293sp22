cegme	training	ashton kutcher	I couldn't image ██████████████ in a serious role, but his performance truly
SarahBrown	training	Ashton Kutcher	I'll admit that I was reluctant to see it because from what I knew of ██████████████ he was only able to do comedy.
SarahBrown	training	Noonan	The acting is all up to ██████ and he carries his thankless character perfectly.
SarahBrown	training	Picasso	███████ was a finer draftsman and a brilliant artist at that age than many artists will ever become in a lifetime.
SarahBrown	training	Tom Noonan	The incredible performance by ██████████ is brilliant and provocative and the editing, sound design, cinematography and directing are truly inspired.
SarahBrown	training	Shabana Azmi	 Her Excellency Madam ████████████ has worked in countless movies over life time.
SarahBrown	training	Mehta	These two genres (i.e. deep meaningful alternative-love story and comic satire) usually mix together just as well as oil and water do, but █████ (somehow) manages to achieve the balance to near perfection.
SarahBrown	training	Mehta	While developing her primary subject matter, █████ manages to achieve this secondary theme skillfully.
SarahBrown	training	Sita	The best example I can give is the parallelism between the 2 female leads(Radha and ████) and the characters of the same name in Hindu mythology.
SarahBrown	training	Sita	████, for example, is the wife of the revered Lord Ram.
SarahBrown	training	Ram	As legend goes, ███ subjugates his wife by making her walk through a Fire to prove her `purity.'
SarahBrown	training	Sita	████, in response, cries and leaves him, reuniting with her mother(the Earth).
SarahBrown	training	Shabana Azmi	This story has all sort of crazy links to the stories of the 2 Indian women(Nandita Das and ████████████).
SarahBrown	training	Deepa Mehta	Hats off to ███████████
SarahBrown	training	Sita	In the oppressed state of affairs as seen in Fire, where good women had to be obedient and do what was correct in the eyes of tradition, there seemed few options for Radha and ████.
SarahBrown	training	Radha	What is life without desire, █████ questions Ashok.
SarahBrown	training	Ms Mehta	I guess the fact that so many women applauded ████████'s work, was because it provided them with an option to think for themselves.
SarahBrown	training	Ms Mehta	Bravo to ████████ in translating her vision so clearly.
SarahBrown	training	Radha	I especially like the flashbacks to the young █████ trying to 'see' for the ocean.
SarahBrown	training	A.R. Rahman	The movie is beautifully filmed and enhanced by the musical score by ███████████.
SarahBrown	training	Ms Deepa's	I look forward to more of ██████████ future productions.
SarahBrown	training	Ashton Kutcher	██████████████ can act!
SarahBrown	training	Deepa Mehta's	"█████████████ ""Fire"" is groundbreaking, bold, and artistic."
SarahBrown	training	A.R. Rahman's	█████████████ music is the work of the genius and almost plays the role of another character in the film.
SarahBrown	training	Deepa Mehta	'Water' (2005), the final part of Toronto-based Indian film-director ███████████'s elemental trilogy has been finally completed, almost ten years after the release of the very first controversial element, 'Fire' (1996), which was followed with a slightly lesser controversial sequel '1947: Earth' (1998).
SarahBrown	training	Camilla	'███████' was Tandy's last picture; she died the very same year.
SarahBrown	training	Deepa Mehta	International fame followed ███████████ in 1996 with the release of the controversial 'Fire', which spread with rage among the false patriotic consciousness existing Indian extremist.
SarahBrown	training	Camilla	Having already explored friendship between two women in '███████', in 'Fire' Mehta went a step further to portray a more intimate relationship between two lonely neglected women.
SarahBrown	training	Kulbhushan Kharbanda	Set in modern day India, the suburbs of the capital city of New Delhi, it shows two brothers and their wives, the elder brother (████████████████████) having joined a weird Hindu sect leads a life of celibacy, faithful to his guru of sexless existence.
SarahBrown	training	Deepa Mehta's	 Two years later, █████████████ second installment was the element of mother earth, released in India by the name of '1947: Earth',yet another excellent movie by a great director, this time in the Hindi language, unlike 'Fire', which was made in the English language.
SarahBrown	training	Deepa Mehta	 Now ███████████ has managed to complete the trilogy, despite a lot of problems, having released the final installment recently, 'Water'.
SarahBrown	training	Nandita Das	The scene where ███████████ loses her virginity to her husband certainly was the first of its kind in Indian cinemas.
SarahBrown	training	Nandita Das	Good acting by all the actors especially ███████████ amidst criticism from the Indian public
SarahBrown	training	Deepa Mehta	I admire ███████████ and this movie is a masterpiece.
SarahBrown	training	Sita	████ still cared enough for him to find that moment to let him know that he is not responsible for her deviant outlet to her blocked desires.
SarahBrown	training	Sita	 But the final act of rejection was by the grandmother - she could not break free from her rusted mindset to accept ████'s desire.
SarahBrown	training	Mehta	"I finally watched the third film in █████'s trilogy: ""Fire""."
SarahBrown	training	Mehta	 █████ is one brave lady: she sees with a clear eye much that is jaundiced, false and repressive about the great society from which she came from.
SarahBrown	training	Mehta	Worse, if someone like █████ has the courage to hold up a mirror to these issues, she faces death threats.
SarahBrown	training	Mehta	█████ is clearly impatient with the totally rigid religious attitudes that either keep widows in misery (Water) or else keep women enslaved to loveless marriages (Fire).
SarahBrown	training	Mehta	In any case █████'s film is a very moving, powerful attempt at sexual discourse that holds modern Indian relationships up to probing scrutiny.
SarahBrown	training	Mehta	█████ is forcing the issues to be looked at no matter how much flack.
SarahBrown	training	Superb	██████, disturbing, provocative, taboo shattering.
SarahBrown	training	Kevin Costner	The trailers looked good, but the water theme was giving me bad flashbacks to the last █████████████ movie that dealt with the subject - Waterworld.
SarahBrown	training	Ashton Kutcher	Plus, despite the promise ██████████████ showed in The Butterfly Effect, I'm still not completely sold on him.
SarahBrown	training	Kenny Rogers'	The movie immediately throws us into the midst of a tense rescue mission, and I was gripped tighter than █████████████ orange face lift.
SarahBrown	training	George Clooney	Sunglasses, a tough guy toothpick in his mouth, and sportin' a smirk that'd make ██████████████ proud?
SarahBrown	training	Costner	I had a bad feeling that the pace would slow too much when ███████ started training the young guys, but on the contrary, the training sessions just might be the most interesting aspect of the film.
SarahBrown	training	Deepa Mehta's	█████████████ somewhat mis-titled FIRE is the first of a loosely connected trilogy, here linked by the theme of the elements, and more symbolic than consuming.
SarahBrown	training	Sita	One husband married a vivacious young woman, ████, out of family obligation.
SarahBrown	training	Sita	This arranged marriage is uncomfortable for them both but in the beginning ████ makes an attempt to connect with her sullen husband.
SarahBrown	validation	Sita	However, he sees himself as a victim and could have cared less about ████--and he continues to have an affair with a liberal-minded Chinese lady.
SarahBrown	validation	Sita	In their dead marriage, sex was purely meant to produce children and there was no way ████ could have any of her sexual or emotional needs met.
SarahBrown	validation	Deepa Mehta	By the way, director ███████████ (a popular female director) has made several other wonderful films such as EARTH and BOLLYWOOD/Hollywood.
SarahBrown	validation	Deepa Mehta	This is my first ███████████ film.
SarahBrown	validation	Radha	I also note that it is █████ who underwent the allegorical trial by fire in the film and not Nita/Sita.
SarahBrown	validation	Ms Mehta	Yet what I loved about the film was its screenplay by ████████, not her direction.
SarahBrown	validation	Ms Mehta	 ████████ seems to fumble as a director (however, compared to most Indian mainstream cinema she would seem to be brilliant) as she cannot use her script to go beyond the microscopic joint family she is presenting except presenting a glimpse of the Chinese micro-minority in the social milieu of India.
SarahBrown	validation	Mehta	█████'s film of two bisexual ladies in an Indian middle-class household may be sacrilege to some, but merely captures the atrophy of middle-class homes that does not seem to aspire for something better than its immediate survival in a limited social space.
SarahBrown	validation	Ms Das	██████ sparkled due to her screen presence rather than her acting capability.
SarahBrown	validation	Ms Mehta	I am sure ████████ can hone her writing talents in her future screenplays.
SarahBrown	validation	Claudio Carvalho	Previous reviewer ████████████████ gave a much better recap of the film's plot details than I could.
SarahBrown	validation	William Faulkner's	This intelligent, moving and beautiful film is a study in the ways people react to tradition (reminds me of ██████████████████ novels).
SarahBrown	validation	GI Jane	We have all seen this plot line before (Top Gun, ███████, An Officer and a Gentleman) but a good script still works.
SarahBrown	validation	Ashton	I am happy to say that ██████ is great in this part.
SarahBrown	validation	Ben Randall	"However, the use of humor, the exploration of the toughness of the training and the fun of watching ███████████ ""do his own thing as a trainer"", kept me riveted and thoroughly entertained."
SarahBrown	validation	Shabana Azmi	To my mind, the very character played by ████████████ is a symbol of the Indian feminine protest against the Indian society.
SarahBrown	validation	Nandita Das	I was impressed with ███████████, who was quite attractive, and played her character with total earnestness.
SarahBrown	validation	Shabana Azmi	But I was even more impressed with ████████████, who I understand is a long-time fixture of Bollywood.
SarahBrown	validation	Oldboy	"Besides the apparent connections with ""██████"" (and Park-wook's other films), an incestuous relation in this one really disturbed me, and also the subtle erotic theme that hung around all the vampiric, physical action."
SarahBrown	validation	Stanley Kubrick	Park-wook has really, really mastered his cinematography in this film, and owes a lot to ███████████████; there are a whole lot of beautiful shots strewn throughout the film, some for simple effects and some that require several glances and probably repeated views to fully catch.
SarahBrown	validation	Chan-wook Park's	████████████████ new film is a complex film that is not easy to classify.
SarahBrown	validation	Emile Zola's	"The film takes its own matters and mixes them with classic European literature, in this case ████████████ ""Thérèse Raquin""."
SarahBrown	validation	Chan-wook Park's	Although I've never seen the film, I couldn't help but feel like this was ████████████████ version of Twilight.
SarahBrown	validation	Park	The psychological aspect that I love about ████'s previous films is in Thirst, as well.
SarahBrown	validation	Chan-wook Park	██████████████ bites into the vampire mythology with Thirst and puts his own dark, psychological twist on it.
SarahBrown	validation	Park Chan-wook	Anything ██████████████ creates is guaranteed to be unique, brilliant, and very twisted at a minimum.
SarahBrown	validation	Park Chan-wook	As negative as it may sound the positives definitely outweigh the negatives and another volume has without a doubt been added to the dark and twisted Zeitgeist of ██████████████ film.
SarahBrown	validation	Bakjwi	That was not the case when I watched ██████, under the American title Thirst.
SarahBrown	validation	Bakjwi	 There aren't many negatives I can say about ██████.
SarahBrown	validation	Dracula	"""bakjwi"" literally means bat in korean and we all know that in many classic vampire stories, you see count ███████ or vampires turning into a bat and fly away or wuheva."
SarahBrown	testing	aesop	Duality of human nature = if you ever read █████'s fables, there is this one fable where mammals and birds are fighting and a bat just can't seem to take a side and it tries to play both sides to his advantage.
SarahBrown	testing	Chan-wook	We all know what █████████ Park can do.
SarahBrown	testing	Chan-wook Park	██████████████ is a master of cinematography and this movie is no exception.
SarahBrown	testing	Chan-wook Park	██████████████ is no stranger to controversy as we know, and this film touches on taboo almost as much as oldboy.
SarahBrown	testing	Chan-wook Park's	I'm the first to recognize that ████████████████ Thirst is exceptionally well made, but spending over two hours with Tae-joo(OK-vin Kim)is enough for anyone to tolerate for such a length of time.
SarahBrown	testing	Hyeon	Instead of legitimately dying, █████ becomes a vampire, always yearning for the sustenance blood gives for him to fight off an infectious disease which returns causing the symptoms which flat-lined him to begin with(..bumps/sores, and the body vomits blood).
SarahBrown	testing	Hyeon	Sunlight, as is known in the vampire genre, causes torturous death if exposed to █████ for a length of time.
SarahBrown	testing	Hyeon	In doing so, █████ has created a monster.
SarahBrown	testing	Kang	Tae-joo admits(..though a slip of the tongue)that, in fact, ████-woo never hurt her, and as she thirsts for blood it is soon realized that killing for a supply doesn't bother her morally or psychologically.
SarahBrown	testing	Hyeon	Innocent people die because of █████'s love(..what once was lust shifts into an obsessive love by the end)for Tae-joo, and it will cease to end if he doesn't make a painful choice.
